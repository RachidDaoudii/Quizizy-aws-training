    "2) B – AWS DMS helps users migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. AWS DMS can migrate data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.",

Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security for AWS account settings and resources.",
